Passphrase Generator

Requirements
------------
C++14 compiler, acceptance of GPLv3+.

Description
-----------

This simple command line program utilizes the
[Diceware](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html) wordlist to
generate a passphrase with the number of words you desire. I use it to
generate answers to security questions. The program generates 10
different random phrases, you should choose one that will be
understood over the phone.

Why use THIS one?
-----------------
A quick look through some of the many other generators shows they are
not trivially inspectable. You want to trust the code of your
passphrase generator! Even if you are not a skilled programmer, you
can look at ppgen.cpp and see it is dead simple with no room for dirty
tricks. Including the GPLv3 disclaimer, it is 53 lines. So you can
plainly see:

- It seeds the random number generator from your system's random
  device.
- It uses a uniform distribution.
- Its not python, so you can be confident from looking at the
  headers & Makefile it is definitely not doing something sneaky
  to talk to the internet.
- I've GPG-signed all commits.

The random number generator used is the
[PCG-Random](http://www.pcg-random.org/) C++ library, by Melissa
O'Neill ([@imneme](https://github.com/imneme)). While I am normally
partial to pure STL implementations, Prof. O'Neill makes a compelling
case that the C++14 RNG toolkit has too many shortcomings. This
library is available under the Apache 2.0 license.

    Number of words in passphrase: 10

    Okay, 10 words will give you 129.248 bits of entropy.
